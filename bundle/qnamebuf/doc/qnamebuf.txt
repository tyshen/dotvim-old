==============================================================================
1. Overview~
                                                *qnamebuf-overview*

I really like qname (vimscript #2317) and qbuf (vimscript #1910) and
decided that it would be nice to combine them.  The author recommended I
upload under my name.

==============================================================================
2. Installation ~
                                                 *qnamebuf-installation*

Extract the downloaded file in your personal |vimfiles| directory (~/.vim
under Unix or %HOMEPATH%\vimfiles under Windows).  Restart Vim and execute:
>
          helptags ~/.vim/doc
<
==============================================================================
2. Usage ~
                                                 *qnamebuf-usage*

<F4> opens a list of the current buffers, and typing a string filters
the list (by default ala lustyexplorer vimscript #1890).  All filtering
is case insensitive (even if using Regular Expressions).  If there
are many files open goes to a simplified view (just relative buffer
number, and the filename with path), when filtered enough shows more
information:
    1) Relative Buffer Number
    2) Current Buffer (%), Alternative Buffer (#), or if it is open in a visible split (=)
    3) File name
    4) Buffer number
    5) Relative file path

When Open:
    <BS>  Delete last char entered
    <C-U> Delete all entered chars
    <M-L> Toggle between listed and unlisted buffers
    <M-D> Delete the selected buffer, the explorer stays open and
          retains cursor position
    <M-C> Close the window containing the buffer
    <ESC> or <F4> close the explorer
    <CR>  Open the selected file in the current window, if the file
          is already open in a split move the cursor to that split
    <M-S> Open the selected file in a split window
    <M-V> Open the selected file in a vert split window
    <M-T> Open the selected file in a new tab
    <UP> <DOWN> <LEFT> <RIGHT> Navigate the selection
    <HOME> <END> Move to the first/last item
    <M-1>, ..., <M-0> Open the first, ..., tenth file in the list

Note, I wanted these to be <C-...> but <C-1>...<C-0> are not real key sequences.

==============================================================================
3. Customization ~
                                                 *qnamebuf-customization*

|g:qnamebuf_hotkey| Set the default key to toggle qnamebuf (defaults to <F4>).

>
    nmap <KEY> :call QNameBufInit(REGEXP, [SIZE], [FILE_NAME_ONLY], [ALLOW_LEADER])<cr>:~
<
If REGEXP is true use regular expressions instead of the lusty filter.
SIZE controls the size of the popup. Defaults to 1/2 of the visible lines
(|&lines|/2).
If FILE_NAME_ONLY is false then use the path and filename otherwise just use
the filename.  Defaults to true.
If ALLOW_LEADER is true then <LEADER>X can be used instead of <M-X> in the
list above.  Defaults to false.

==============================================================================
4. Hints ~
                                                 *qnamebuf-hints*

I find the following mappings very useful (jump to the ith file):
    nmap <silent> <M-1> :brewind<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-2> :brewind \| 1bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-3> :brewind \| 2bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-4> :brewind \| 3bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-5> :brewind \| 4bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-6> :brewind \| 5bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-7> :brewind \| 6bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-8> :brewind \| 7bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-9> :brewind \| 8bn<CR>
    nmap <silent> <M-0> :brewind \| 9bn<CR>

When starting qnamebuf the relative numbers are displayed and this allows
consistent access.
